# Seed PRD: *Audience Store*

### 1. Overview

The Audience Store is a simple web application that allows users to:

1. Sign up and create an account with a username and password.
2. List products for sale (real or imaginary).
3. Spend “credits” to buy items listed by other users.
4. See a marketplace feed of available items and their sellers.

This app is intended as a teaching demo to illustrate how AI can support the full product lifecycle from requirements → code → deploy.

### 2. Goals

* Demonstrate the risks of “vibe-coded” prototypes (hardcoded data, monolithic files, exposed PII).
* Show how AI-powered PRD → scaffolding → structured architecture improves quality and maintainability.
* Provide an interactive, engaging app experience for workshop participants.

---

### 3. Core Features

**User Accounts**

* Sign up with username + password (stored securely).
* Login/logout flow.
* Each user starts with a fixed credit balance (e.g., 100 credits).

**Marketplace**

* Create a product listing:

  * Title (string).
  * Description (string).
  * Price (integer credits).
* View all products in a shared marketplace feed.

**Transactions**

* Buy a product if you have enough credits.
* Credits deducted from buyer, added to seller.
* Product marked as sold (no longer in active feed).

**AI Enhancement (optional/fun)**

* Auto-generate witty product descriptions with Claude/Gemini when an item is listed.

### 4. Entities & Schema (First Draft)

* **User**

  * `id` (UUID)
  * `username` (unique string)
  * `password_hash` (string)
  * `credits` (int, default = 100)

* **Product**

  * `id` (UUID)
  * `title` (string)
  * `description` (string)
  * `price` (int)
  * `seller_id` (FK → User.id)
  * `status` (enum: available/sold)

* **Transaction**

  * `id` (UUID)
  * `buyer_id` (FK → User.id)
  * `product_id` (FK → Product.id)
  * `amount` (int)
  * `timestamp` (datetime)

---

### 5. User Flows

**Signup/Login**

* New user enters username + password → account created with 100 credits.
* Existing user logs in to see marketplace.

**Listing an Item**

* User fills out form (title, description, price).
* Item appears in marketplace feed.
* (Optional) Claude/Gemini enhances description.

**Buying an Item**

* User clicks “Buy.”
* Check: enough credits? product available?
* If valid → transaction processed:

  * Buyer’s credits reduced.
  * Seller’s credits increased.
  * Product marked sold.

**Viewing Marketplace**

* All available products listed with seller + price.
* Sold products may be shown separately or hidden.

---

### 6. Constraints & Non-Goals

* Credits are fake; no real money involved.
* No need for advanced features like search, categories, or ratings in v1.
* Minimal styling is acceptable (focus on function > design).
* Deployment target: Codespaces → quick deploy (Netlify, Vercel, or Render).

---

### 7. Risks to Watch For (Discussion Hooks)

* **Bad path demo**: credentials stored in plaintext, products hardcoded in frontend.
* **Good path demo**: password hashing, DB schema, clean separation of concerns.
* **Concurrency**: what if two people try to buy the same item?
* **PII**: never store user info directly in the frontend bundle.

---

### 8. Stretch Ideas (if time)

* Leaderboard: who has the most credits after trading?
* “Funny product descriptions” auto-generated by Claude.
* Add categories (food, art, swag) to listings.

---

💡 **How you’ll use this**:

* Feed this exact PRD into Claude in Hour 2.
* Let it expand/over-specify (Claude loves edge cases).
* Then have teams poke holes: “Where’s the logout flow?” “What about duplicate usernames?” etc.
* That back-and-forth is half the learning.
